These files implement SCHEME primitives and SCHEME procedures defined in SICP.
My goal was to implement 
symbolic differentiation (SICP 2.3.2), 
streams (SICP 3.5), 
metacircular evaluator (SICP 4.1)

in Scheme, but I was having trouble with MIT Scheme on Windows. So... I decided to implement the primitives in python.

I achieved my goal:
I learned the material in SICP at a deeper level by actually running (and debugging) my solutions to problems. (Learned a lot by debugging!)
